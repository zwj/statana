      weblog_parse - extract specified fields from a web log file

Reads a web server log file, in either "Common Logfile Format" or
"Combined Logfile Format".  Parses it, and writes out only the
user-specified fields, separated by tabs for easier handling.

This is intended as a utility for writing web-log statistics
generators.  It's written in C and is very fast.

In addition to just extracting specified fields, the program can
also do some simple database-like conditional matching.

See the manual entry for more details.
